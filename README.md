Web alternative to [LRCGET](https://github.com/tranxuanthang/lrcget), inspired by [https://github.com/magic-akari/lrc-maker](https://github.com/magic-akari/lrc-maker).

## TODO

1. Lyric editing  
2. Functionality with LRCLIB API (GET /api/search param 'q' & POST)

4. Uploading files via YouTube and SoundCloud
